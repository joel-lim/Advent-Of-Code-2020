# Advent of Code 2020

This repository is home to my solutions for the Advent of Code (see https://adventofcode.com/).

The solutions will mainly be in Python, with equivalents in C++ as I am trying to familiarise myself with the language (if I am sufficiently motivated to do so).

Thanks for dropping by!
